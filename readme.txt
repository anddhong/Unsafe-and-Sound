Run the gameDemo.py file, but give it a few
seconds as the modules take a while to load,
along with the setup. Download all the necessary images
in the folder,and place them in the same area so that
the game can find these images. If you do not have
the module librosa, pyaudio, or pygame, download those
as well.
