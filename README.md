# Unsafe-and-Sound
 multiplayer shooting game in built with Pygame that uses beat detection to create the games levels.
 *Make sure that Pygame, Pyaudio, and Librosa modules are installed 
 
Instructions: Run the gameDemo.py file, but give it a few
seconds as the modules take a while to load,
along with the setup. Download all the necessary images
,and place them in the same folder such that
the game can find these images. If you do not have
the module librosa, pyaudio, or pygame, download those
as well. Instructions for how to play the game are included in the game's
menu. The Score.txt file is used to keep track of high scores.
