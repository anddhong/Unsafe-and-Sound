# Unsafe-and-Sound
 multiplayer shooting game in built with Pygame that uses beat detection to create the games levels
Instructions: Run the gameDemo.py file, but give it a few
seconds as the modules take a while to load,
along with the setup. Download all the necessary images
,and place them in the same folder such that
the game can find these images. If you do not have
the module librosa, pyaudio, or pygame, download those
as well.
